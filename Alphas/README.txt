Controls -- 

Arrow Keys / WASD - Movement
"N" - Next Level
Alt + F4 - Quit

Notes:

There is no audio in the game at the minute, that isn't broken 

You can go forward in levels with the N key if you want

Up to level 70 is in the game and functional

If you experience any bugs, just write me an angrily worded message on social media somewhere

everything you see is subject to change
